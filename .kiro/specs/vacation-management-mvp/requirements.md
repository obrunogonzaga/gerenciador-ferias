# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Vacation Management MVP is a web-based system designed to digitize and streamline the vacation request process for Brazilian companies. This MVP focuses on the core workflow: employees submitting vacation requests, managers approving/rejecting them, and basic administrative oversight. The system ensures compliance with Brazilian labor laws (CLT) while providing a modern, user-friendly experience that eliminates manual bureaucratic processes.

The MVP will serve as the foundation for a comprehensive vacation management platform, focusing on essential functionality that delivers immediate value to small and medium-sized companies.
